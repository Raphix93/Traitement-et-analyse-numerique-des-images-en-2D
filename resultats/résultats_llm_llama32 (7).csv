Although not apparent at first glance, taking time to zoom in on the image reveals a gathering of women adjacent to the train station at Gare de Sainte-Beuve. On the upper floor above them, shuttered windows stand out. These windows create shade, further adding a layer of reading to the attic space. This image holds significant historical importance in documenting preparations leading up to the Shafer Campaign.

There is a faint mark of the print's tone and color alteration near the train, visible in the undertaken approached cropping of the image.

A photograph of a railway stop with a building, presumably a station building of the railway stop, and other attendant buildings.

### Indices

Cyclopean Test used: Subject focus/Movements direct towards subject/Subject layered/compositional frame points to subject/ vantage point-neutral

**Object references:**

* 1. Locomotive cars with render visible train attendant, white steam
* 2. Tiered buildings on station platform with entrance frame to the interior
* 3. Composition contains a neat background-mountains, and other attendant buildings, thus enhancing the concentration on foreground subject and details.
* 4. signage clues at station, including ""BUFFET"" serving platform.

### Objects of Notice

(General)
* trees lining background to the subject
* a negligible amount of grass in foreground
* consideration and attention to small details that stand unique like ground below and homes/mountains in the background

_""Archival Photographs Illustrating Historical/Pre-Historic Globally Varying Land Ownership Proportions""_,RequestParameddigitalArchiveExample

The image depicts a small town, distantly separated from mountains and embodying surrounding areas like an aerial landscape representing curated photographs that represent the vast variety of the proportions of ownership of land around the globe in a historic traditional context with inspiring admiration. 

Libraries commonly index archival photographs different than literary works as required by the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) vocabulary system for indexing. Dianne Harris classifies, historical photographs through time with prime context using specializations with an ""Archival"" and cultural studies subject accessible across a collective framework to cross-index similar archival objects. 

The small town in the photograph may not represent an exact determination of ownership rights through land dividing measurements and landscapes in qualitative concrete areas. However, it serves as a concrete expression of possession and generation as past and progress through the periods over time it and well leading heads of library holdings that is governmental nature through symbolic rich accompanying cultural humanistic frameworks. These examples of historical photographs serve well the principles of the inventive and progressive use of photographic images, in worldwide pre-historic milaney similar to other collection holdings where the story is least illustrated. On 103 witness fields one gets an insight and broad interpretation of the importance of gigantic proportions of land and prized entitlement.

These photographs are seen as central to the photographs' identity as they portray how the past lives on with it when comparison with captured black and white motion collapse illustrating farmers towns, and machinery working in different land sizes is seen through the lens over a progression of history with the traditional overview and newly written archival reports comprehensively expressed. The photographs' significance is noted in the library catalog, with the focus on disengaging discovery meanings from a cultural framework combining as evidence of land, hope, and meaning seen in subjects satisfactorily documenting tribal, owners, philosophers' accounts across the world.

1. Aerial photograph
2. Summer, landscape

Geographic Area:
1. Unknown (Appreciate certain geographical features in the image including mountains, forests, and a lake)

Period Context:
1. World War 2 end, peacekeeping, new beginnings, probably leading to a population boom as allied familes came to rest, set up homes and call the village home. Against that sparse population, the variety of dwellings noted on the map grew (Second homes or 'vacation homes' were common and rented out by young families during the peak holiday times).

Structural Features:
1. Various private residences
2. Boathouses along the water
3. Large farms or fields making use of the area's ground, surrounded by woods, and forestcies.

The above mentioned features of the Aerial photograph give a brief note on what this could be. This is only a partial list, however, of the features that could be examined with a closer eye of detail. In fact, the historical data and further historical information gives much detailed perspective on the area."

These buildings are encircled by trees, and are accessed by a bridge spanning Léman Lake; this body of water is quite large and is surrounded by the terrain of the Gary with smaller foothills surrounding the large mountain. In the distant background, there are dense tree-covered foothills which constitute the region of Montagne de la Chèvre, only a few miles from the surrounding mountains. Some of the foothills are cultivated, as seen by the distinct crops grown. The original photograph taken by the architect photographer Hugentol of Geneva shows the beauty of the townscape in intricate detail.

Note that the photographer is not mentioned in the image source, so because of unknown information or lack of sources, the following subject headings are not connected to this set of data: ""wealth distribution"", ""democracy vs autocracy"", ""seasonal variation"".
