### Keywords

- scene: several robust trees on each side of a narrow path
- soil: pointed hill
- structure: 3 blue low stories with a 4th tall, roofless extension
- grass: grass ponds/slow-moving streams

### Inference

- Time: located on the 4th hillside, this expansion will likely be a military infrastructure * based on its removal of the upper roof and appear several decades old. The mud slop floor is also a common agricultural scene observed on the settler frontier.
- Build: centered houses, surrounded for protection by fringing forest leaf cover, this home is common for landless renters or small farmstead property smaller than 40-60 acres.
- Position: Assorted wavy hills and broad-leafed forest appear as a background. Rambunctious to small farm labor, two to four individuals typically till the land on patchwork farms lying within this context.
- Cult: harsh winters occurring to wooded areas appear in the deciduous leaf ecology of this image, suggesting it is in a cooler semi-continental zone vs other parts of the US such as the swampy wetlands of the south and Southwest US. 
- Product: Blankets, fabrics, and paper were the primary industries in the US late 19th century. Given the farmhouse road and broad forest perimeter, sawmills or associated wood-related industry are likely to be the primary product labor in this picture. 

### Use

- Other potential uses shared by this image and map of the MSV Colony likely to be the Northern plains of fair or coin farming and trade. Nearby frozen cells, the given pedagogy of lost at sea assumes extreme need for food, supplies, sanitation, and proper healthcare. Extreme.

The image presents an old house with a light and shadow contrast against the left and right sides of the photo, respectively. The left side of the house is shaped like a roof, and in front of it, there is a newly constructed concrete-aged house structure. The right side of the house features brick structures and ages on the wall are apparent. It is unclear if the kids depicted are walking to the old aged house and newly constructed one, or they are their owners. Nevertheless, the dust, gray tone, and the way kids dress dictate the line LEDs are realistic; this represents an arid contemporary residing with its people. Given this, ""Lonely Landscape"" could mean isolation in an area with limited resources, energy, and functionality.
